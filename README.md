This repo is an example project from the odin project, which is part of my journey of catching up on the web development that I neglected to learn in my younger teens.

This project will just be a simple website that links to a few recipes.

The skills that would be demonstrated at the end of the project would be:
- Basic HTML
- Anchor links
- Images 
etc
