        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> Gnocchi is simple to make with just three ingredients: mashed potato, flour, and egg. This recipe is one my family has used for generations.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 potatoes, peeled</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool, and mash with a fork or potato masher. </p></li>
            <li><p>Combine 1 cup mashed potato, flour, and egg in a large bowl. Knead until dough forms a ball. Shape small portions of the dough into long "snakes". On a floured surface, cut snakes into 1/2-inch pieces.</p></li>
            <li><p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Drop in gnocchi and cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until gnocchi have risen to the top; drain and serve.</p></li>
        </ol>
